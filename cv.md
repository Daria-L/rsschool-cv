###3. Summary###
The life is too short and the time is too valuable to spend it at unpleasant and low-paid work -
that is what I&apos;ve understood after some months of work at manufacture. So from that
moment my goal was to get a job that would be enough interesting and challenging for me,
would bring enough money to satisfy my primitive needs and would leave me some time for
hobbies and rest. So this is one of the reasons why I chose to try myself at programming.

Another reason was the fact that I have some predispositions and interest to it. I can learn
new things pretty fast due to good genetics and my youth I guess. Furthermore, I tried
myself earlier at programming and it was intriguing me, so I would like to explore this field
better.

    return this.a + this.b;
  };
